## About
Extracting impulsive information under strong background noise and harmonic interference
is a challenging problem for bearing fault diagnosis. Multi-scale transforms have achieved
great success in extracting impulsive feature information, however, how to choose a suitable
transform is a difficult problem, especially in the case of strong noise interference. Therefore,
dictionary learning methods have attracted more and more attention in recent years.
A weighted multi-scale dictionary learning model (WMSDL) is proposed in this paper which
integrates the multi-scale transform and fault information into a unified dictionary learning
model and it successfully overcomes four disadvantages of traditional dictionary learning
algorithms including lacking the multi-scale property; restricting training samples to
local patches; being sensitive to strong harmonic interference; suffering from high computational
complexity. Moreover, algorithmic derivation, computational complexity and parameter
selection are discussed. Finally, The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by
both the numerical simulations and experiments. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art
methods further demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.
